# Description
This folder contains examples of scalable training using DeepSNAP. We will provide an easy to use API for distributed training.

# Current Examples
We provide a sample implementation of distributed GraphSAGE for node classification. For comparison we also provide a single worker implementation for node classification.

# Future Examples
Link prediction, GraphSAINT, ClusterGCN & Partitioning
